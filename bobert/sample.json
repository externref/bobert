      "description": "1. **Reporting a server member**\n - Provide clear evidence: When reporting a server member for misconduct, provide screenshots, chat logs, or any other evidence to support your claim. This helps moderators or admins assess the situation accurately.

Present the information calmly and respectfully.\n2. **Appealing an infraction**\n - Understand the rules: Before appealing an infraction, familiarize yourself with the server's rules and guidelines. Make sure you understand why the infraction was issued and whether you believe it was justified.\n - Provide context: When appealing, explain your side of the story and provide any relevant context that may have been overlooked. Be honest and transparent in your communication.\n3. **Submit for formal inquiries**\n - It's best to submit a ticket and speak with a staff member for formal inquiries like partnerships. This ensures that your inquiry is directed to the appropriate channel or individual responsible for handling such requests.\n4. **Asking in the public support thread for general questions**\n - Check existing resources: Before posting in the public support thread (<#1203404592268705842>), check if your question has already been answered in FAQs, documentation, or previous posts. Avoid asking questions that have already been addressed to prevent redundancy.\n - Be concise: If your question is straightforward and doesn't require a detailed response, be concise in your post. Provide enough information to get a helpful answer without overwhelming the thread."
